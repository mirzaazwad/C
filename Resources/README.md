# Resources

This section contains resources to aid in one's competitive programming journey. Now it is nearly impossible to complete all of these resources. 'Nearly' being the keyword.
So keeping that in mind, I only accumulated these resources from friends, peers and instructors but they are not everything or near complete. I did not go through all
of these myself and I don't think I would be able to.

The Resources primarily contains codes, problem solves etc. from different authors as well as their implementations of various algorithms etc. It is here essentially to allow black boxing to solve certain problems whose algorithm implementation is beyond my scope of knowledge.
