# Resources

This section contains resources to aid in one's competitive programming journey. Now it is nearly impossible to complete all of these resources. 'Nearly' being the keyword.
So keeping that in mind, I only accumulated these resources from friends, peers and instructors but they are not everything or near complete. I did not go through all
of these myself and I don't think I would be able to.

The Black Box Codes contains codes from Different Authors and various implementations, problem solves by these authors along with other resources given by those individual mentioned authors.
