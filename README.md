# Competitive Programming

###### Starting Date: 15 June 2021
This is the repository where I outline my competitive programming experiences and approaches to different problems. I hope to upload my codes along with the new approaches I learnt throughout this journey. I don't know how far I'd go or where I would end up but I am hoping things work out and I manage to make a mark in my competitive programming journey.

###### Some of the most useful resources that I looked into:

Also look into A2OJ ladders for finding more practice problems sorted by difficulty, just go to google and search, >A2OJ Ladder
These resoruces are also the contributions of various individuals who helped shape my CP journey. Especially those at IUT who taught me the basics via the ACM classes.
