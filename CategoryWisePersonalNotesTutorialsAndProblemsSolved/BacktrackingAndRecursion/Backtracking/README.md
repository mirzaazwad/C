# Backtracking

Backtracking is just a solution approach its not really a new idea but rather an approach to solve particular problems. 
Backtracking makes use of the idea of recursion and it can be implemented by following these basic steps:
1) Place yourself at a starting position

2) Explore all the paths possible from the starting point

3) Insert your element at any correct possible position and once inserted move onto smaller problem or next level

4) Once you reach the base case print your solution

5) Once you explore all paths from one point, backtrack to your previous point upon not reaching base case
