# Data Structures 

This directory contains various data structures and their implementations in a series of problems. The use of different data structures are necessary but beware, it is important
to understand which data structure is necessary for a given problem and to understand the complexities of these data structures. I would also be including codes for the implementation
of these data structures for detailed understanding of how these work. Along with different sample problems in which the data structures have been applied.
