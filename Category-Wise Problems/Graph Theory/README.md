# Graph Theory
Graph theory is one of the most essential parts of competitive programming contests and such, basically it deals with various types of graphs as defined mathematically(Discrete Mathematics)
in a way such that these graphs consists of edges that join one node to another. Nodes are essentially like leaves on a tree with the edges being joining them.
Graphs are a good starting point for understanding other data structures such as different forms of trees. A node is also often called a vertex. 
So there are many different ways to represent graphs as discussed here:
