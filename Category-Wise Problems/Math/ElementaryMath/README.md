###### A commonly used equation 3)


When N=2<sup>d</sup>×a (a: even), the set of the divisors of N is:

> {2<sup>i</sup>×j∣0≤i≤d,j is a divisor of a}

Thus, if
N has m odd divisors, it has dm even divisors.

Therefore, the answer is:

Even, if N is divisible by 4;
Same, if N is divisible by 2 but not by 4;
Odd, if N is not divisible by 2.
