# Extended Euclidean Algorithm

###### Helpful resources:

> [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/extended-euclid-algorithm.html) This also contains, practice problems, I would give the solutions in the problems section for this topic
> [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/euclidean-algorithms-basic-and-extended/)
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) This is just to know about the background and certain applications as in bascially extra tidbits
> [A Brief Mathematical Understanding](http://www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m5410/exeucalg.html)


I would discuss my implementation of the algorithm very soon.
